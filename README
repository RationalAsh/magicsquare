|    This is a program that makes magic squares that contain an odd number of rows or columns. It follows        |
|    a special algorithm to generate the magic square. I will explain the algorithm here using a 3x3 square      |
|    as an example.                                                                                              |
|                                                                                                                |
|    1. First draw a 3x3 grid on a piece of paper.                                                               |
|                                                                                                                |
|    2. Go to the right edge column and find the cell that is in the middle of the column. In the case of        |
|       the 3x3 grid the position of this cell is Row 2, Column 3. For a 5x5 it would be Row 3, column 5.        |
|                                                                                                                |
|    3. Write down 1 on that square.                                                                             |
|                                                                                                                |
|    4. To find the cell in which 2 must be filled, increase the index of the row and the column by 1. If the    |
|       row or column index exceeds the maximum round back to the first index. For example in the 3x3 grid, if   |
|       you're at position 2,3 the next position is 3,4. Since 4 exceeds the maximum value of the index, 4       |
|       becomes 3 so next position after 2,3 is 3,1.                                                             |
|                                                                                                                |
|    5. If the next cell you need to fill already contains a number, stay on the same row but move one column    |
|       to the right to get to the next cell. For example, in the case of the 3x3 grid, after filling position   |
|       1,2 with the number three, the next position is 2,3 which already contains the number 1. So following    |
|       the rule above, the next position to fill is 1,1.                                                        |
|                                                                                                                |
|    6. If you reach the bottom right corner of the grid (position 3,3 for the 3x3 grid), the next position is   |
|       1,1. But this is already filled. So the next position would be shited to the left.So after 3,3 comes 3,2.|
